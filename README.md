## Repository Overview

This repository contains examples of my previous work in data manipulation and data analysis in Python and R.

### Folder Descriptions

#### Automating Data Manipulation Example 1
This folder demonstrates how to:
- Manipulate a single CSV file.
- Loop over a folder full of CSV files with the same data structure.

We process our data in the `/Before` folder and then export the modified files, named "_done.csv", into the `/Before/test` folder. The script used is `Automating_Data_manipulation.r`. Please update the path to your working directory using `getwd()`.
